# Platformer
## What is it?
This is a platforming game that I am working on.  It
features a tile-based map.

It also features a modular engine, with different components
separated from each other.  For example, the camera class is 
completely separated from the player class, and the player class
does not even know what a pixel is.

## How to play

&#11013;&#11015;&#11014;&#10145;:Move around.
