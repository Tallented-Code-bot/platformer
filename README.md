# Platformer
## What is it?
This is a platforming game that I am working on.  It
features a tile-based map.

It also features a modular engine, with different components
separated from each other.  For example, the camera class is 
completely separated from the player class, and the player class
does not even know what a pixel is.

## How to play

## Ideas
### Player Ideas
### Enemy Ideas
- An hourglass that slowly runs out of sand.  When the sand runs out,
something happens.  The player might be able to do something to slow
or stop the sand, or flip the enemy over to run the other way.

- A ball/boulder-like enemy that rolls and tries to crush you.  This
enemy may not work well until there are slopes in the game.
